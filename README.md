Vagrant OpenStack Provider
This is a Vagrant 1.1+ plugin that adds an OpenStack provider to Vagrant, allowing Vagrant to control and provision machines in OpenStack.

NOTE: This plugin requires Vagrant 1.1+, which is still unreleased. Vagrant 1.1 will be released soon. In the mean time, this repository is meant as an example of a high quality plugin using the new plugin system in Vagrant.

          Warning! By not specifying a custom public/private keypair,
          Vagrant is defaulting to use the insecure keypair that ships with
          Vagrant. While this isn't much of a big deal for local development,
          this is quite insecure for remote servers. Please specify a custom
          public/private keypair.
